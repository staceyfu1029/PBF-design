Reproduce workflow:

1. For Figure 3&4 or Table 2:

Step 1: simulate toxicity profiles
  input the target toxicity phi and number of dose K in the code Skeleton_list.R. 10,000 scenarios will be generated. 

Step 2: run simulations and save the output
  run simulations for the simulated toxicity profiles. PoP, BOIN, Keyboard, and CRM designs can implemented using the corresponding codes that are provided in this GitHub repositories (PoP.R, BOIN. R, Keyboard.R, and CRM.R). R workspaces should be saved after running those R scripts to generate the figures and tables. 
  
Step 3: generate figures and tables
  with the outputs from step 2 for different simulation settings mentioned in the paper, table 2 can generated using the R script Table2.R. Figure 3 and 4 can be generated using the R script Figure3&4.R. 

2. For Table 3:

Table 3 can be generated using the R script Table3.R
